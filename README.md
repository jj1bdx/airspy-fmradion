  - _main_ is the "production" branch with the most stable release (often ahead of the latest release though)
  - _dev_ is the development branch that contains current developments that will be eventually released in the main branch
  - Other branches are experimental (and presumably abandoned)
  - The `master` branch is deprecated and to be deleted. Use _main_ branch.

## Prerequisites

### Airspy HF+ firmware

Use the latest version of Airspy HF+ firmware, available at [Airspy HF+ Dual Port](https://airspy.com/airspy-hf-plus/) and [Airspy HF+ Discovery](https://airspy.com/airspy-hf-discovery/) Web pages.

airspy-fmradion sets the default sampling rates to 384kHz for FM broadcast, and 192kHz for the other modes. Old Airspy HF+ firmwares do not support the lower sampling rate other than 768kHz.

### Required libraries

Note: the main (formerly master) branch of libvolk is now required from v0.8.1.

If you install from source in your own installation path, you have to specify the include path and library path.
For example if you installed it in `/opt/install/libairspy` you have to add `-DAIRSPY_INCLUDE_DIR=/opt/install/libairspy/include -DAIRSPYHF_INCLUDE_DIR=/opt/install/libairspyhf/include` to the cmake options.

### Debian/Ubuntu Linux

  - `sudo apt-get install cmake pkg-config libusb-1.0-0-dev libasound2-dev libairspy-dev libairspyhf-dev librtlsdr-dev libsndfile1-dev portaudio19-dev`

### macOS

* Install HomeBrew libraries as in the following shell script
* See <https://github.com/pothosware/homebrew-pothos/wiki>
* Use HEAD for `airspy` and `airspyhf`

```shell
brew tap pothosware/homebrew-pothos
brew tap dholm/homebrew-sdr #other sdr apps
brew update
brew install portaudio
brew install libsndfile
brew install rtl-sdr
brew install airspy --HEAD
brew install airspyhf --HEAD
brew install volk
```

### Install the supported libvolk

Install libvolk as described in [libvolk.md](libvolk.md).

### Dependency installation details

#### libvolk

* See [GitHub gnuradio/volk repository](https://github.com/gnuradio/volk) for the details.

#### libairspyhf

Use the latest HEAD version.

#### libairspy

*Note: this is applicable for both macOS and Linux.*

*Install and use the latest libairspy --HEAD version* for:

* Working `airspy_open_devices()`, required by `airspy_open_sn()`. See [this commit](https://github.com/airspy/airspyone_host/commit/61fec20fbd710fc54d57dfec732d314d693b5a2f) for the details.
* Proper transfer block size. `if_blocksize` for Airspy HF+ is reduced from 16384 to 2048, following [this commit](https://github.com/airspy/airspyhf/commit/a1f6f4a0537f53bede6e80c51826fc9d45061c28).

#### git submodules

r8brain-free-src and readerwriterqueue are the submodules of this repository. Download the submodule repositories by the following git procedure:

- `git submodule update --init --recursive`

## Installing

### A quick way

```shell
/bin/rm -rf build
git submodule update --init --recursive
cmake -S . -B build # -DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=ON (if needed)
cmake --build build
```

### In details

To install airspy-fmradion, download and unpack the source code and go to the top level directory. Then do like this:

 - `git submodule update --init --recursive`
 - `mkdir build`
 - `cd build`
 - `cmake ..`

CMake tries to find librtlsdr. If this fails, you need to specify
the location of the library in one the following ways:

```shell
cmake .. \
  -DAIRSPY_INCLUDE_DIR=/path/airspy/include \
  -DAIRSPY_LIBRARY_PATH=/path/airspy/lib/libairspy.a
  -DAIRSPYHF_INCLUDE_DIR=/path/airspyhf/include \
  -DAIRSPYHF_LIBRARY_PATH=/path/airspyhf/lib/libairspyhf.a \
  -DRTLSDR_INCLUDE_DIR=/path/rtlsdr/include \
  -DRTLSDR_LIBRARY_PATH=/path/rtlsdr/lib/librtlsdr.a

PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/path/to/airspy/lib/pkgconfig cmake ..
```

For using static analyzers such as [OCLint](https://oclint.org) and [Clangd](https://clangd.llvm.org), run the following commands:

```
cd build
ln -s `pwd`/compile_commands.json ..
cmake -DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=ON ..
```

### Compile and install

 - `make -j4` (for machines with 4 CPUs)
 - `make install`

### Copying binary to another directory

On M1 Mac, using cp causes a trouble. Use the following command to properly install the command to a local directory:

```shell
install -o user -m 0700 -c -s build/airspy-fmradion $(HOME)/bin
```

 - `-A` (For FM only) Experimental 10Hz-step IF AFC

## Major changes

### Timestamp file format

* For FM: `pps_index sample_index unix_time if_level`
* For the other modes: `block unix_time if_level`
* if\_level is in dB

### Rate compensation for adjusting audio device playback speed offset

* Background: some audio devices shows non-negligible offset of playback speed, which causes eventual audio output buffer overflow and significant delay in long-term playback.
* How to fix: compensating the playback speed offset gives more accurate playback timing, by sacrificing output audio pitch accuracy. A proper compensation will eliminate the cause of increasing output buffer length, by sending less data (lower sampling rate) to the conversion process.
* You can specify the compensation rate by ppm using `-r` option.
* How to estimate the rate offset: when elapsed playback time is `Tp` [seconds] and output buffer length (`buf=` in the debug output) increases during the time is `Ts` [seconds], the compensation rate is `(Ts/Tp) * 1000000` [ppm].
* For example, if the output buffer length increases for 1 second after playing back for 7 hours (25200 seconds), the offset rate is 1/25200 * 1000000 ~= 39.68ppm.
* +- 100ppm offset is not uncommon among the consumer-grade audio devices.
* +- 100ppm pitch change may not be recongizable by human.

#### Caveats for the rate compensation

* *Do not use this feature if the per-sample accuracy is essential.*
* *Do not use this feature for non-realtime output (for example, to files).*
* Output audio pitch increases as the offset increases.
* Too much compensation will cause output underflow.
* This feature causes fractional (non-integer) resampling by `IfResampler` class, which causes more CPU usage.

### Smaller latency

* v0.9.2 uses smaller latency algorithms for all modulation types and filters. The output frequency characteristics may be different from the previous versions.

### Audio gain adjustment

* Since v0.4.2, output maximum level is back at -6dB (0.5) (`adjust_gain()` is reintroduced) again, as in pre-v0.2.7
* During v0.2.7 to v0.4.1, output level was at unity (`adjust_gain()` is removed)
* Before v0.2.7, output maximum level is at -6dB (0.5) 

### Audio and IF downsampling is performed by r8brain-free-src

* Output of the stereo decoder is downsampled to 48kHz
* 19kHz cut LPF implemented for post-processing resampler output
* Audio sample rate is fixed to 48000Hz
* `r8b::CDSPResampler24` is used for IF resampling

### Phase discriminator uses GNU Radio fast\_atan2f() 

* From v0.7.8-pre0, GNU Radio `fast_atan2f()` which has ~20-bit accuracy, is used for PhaseDiscriminator class and the 19kHz pilot PLL.
* The past `fastatan2()` used in v0.6.10 and before was removed due to low accuracy (of ~10 bits)
* Changing from the past `atan2()` to `fast_atan2f()` showed no noticeable difference of the THD+N (0.218%) and THD (0.018%). (Measured from JOBK-FM NHK Osaka FM 88.1MHz hourly time tone 880Hz, using airwaves after the multipath canceler filter of -E36)
* [The past `fastatan2()` allowed +-0.005 radian max error](https://www.dsprelated.com/showarticle/1052.php)
* libm `atan2()` allows only approx. 0.5 ULP as the max error for macOS 10.14.5, measured by using the code from ["Error analysis of system mathematical functions
" by Gaston H. Gonnet](http://www-oldurls.inf.ethz.ch/personal/gonnet/FPAccuracy/Analysis.html) (1 ULP for macOS 64bit `double` = 2^(-53) = approx. 10^(15.95))

### FM multipath filter

* A Normalized LMS-based multipath filter can be enabled after IF AGC
* IF sample stages can be defined by `-E` options
* Reference amplitude level: 1.0
* For Mac mini 2018 with 3.2 GHz Intel Core i7, 288 stages consume 99% of one CPU core
* This filter is not effective when the IF bandwidth is narrow (192kHz)
* The multipath filter starts after discarding the first 100 blocks. This change is to avoid the initial instability of Airspy R2.
* Note: this filter recalculates the coefficients for every four (4) samples, to reduce the processing load.

### Multipath filter configuration

* v0.7.3 and later: -E36 for 108 previous and 36 after stages (ratio 3:1). The multipath filter order: (4 * stages) + 1
* For reference only: v0.7.3-pre1 and before: -E72 for 72 previous and 72 after stages (ratio 1:1), summary: set the -E parameter to 1/2 of the previous value
* Rule of thumb: -E36 is sufficient for a stable strong singal (albeit with considerable multipath distortion).

### FM L-R signal boosted for the stereo separation improvement

* Teruhiko Hayashi suggested boosting L-R signal by 1.017 for a better stereo separation. Implemented since v0.7.6-pre3.
* DiscriminatorEqualizer removed since v1.7.6-pre3 (needs more precise compensation, presumably with an FIR filter.

### FM deemphasis error prevention

* Teruhiko Hayashi suggested applying deemphasis *before* the sampling rate conversion, at the demodulator rate, higher than the audio output rate. Implemented since v0.7.6.

## No-goals

* CIC filters for the IF 1st stage (unable to explore parallelism, too complex to compensate)
* Using lock-free threads (`boost::lockfree::spsc_queue` didn't make things faster, and consumed x2 CPU power)
