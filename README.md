* `-G filename` Write audio data as RF64/WAV `FLOAT_LE` samples. Use filename `-` to write to stdout (_pipe is not supported_)
* `-C filename`  Write audio data to MP3 file of VBR -V 1. Use filename '-' to write to stdout. (_This function is available when linked with supported libsndfile only._)
* `-P device_num` Play audio via PortAudio device index number. Use string `-` to specify the default PortAudio device

## Timestamp file format

* For FM: `pps_index sample_index unix_time if_level`

* if\_level is in dB

## Output audio specification

* Output maximum level is nominally -6dB (0.5) but may increase up to 0dB (1.0)
* Output audio sample rate is fixed to 48000Hz

### FM multipath filter

* A Normalized LMS-based multipath filter can be enabled after IF AGC
